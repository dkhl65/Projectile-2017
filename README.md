# Projectile-2017

This is my grade 12 computer science final project that I worked on with one other student. A physics teacher was acting as our client and we produced software according to his demands. This software animates a projectile shot from a cannon with the velocity that the user enters. It can also solve for values (speed, angle, etc) to hit the target. It is the most complicated software that I have developed.
